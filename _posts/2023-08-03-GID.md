# On August 17th, your GID may change

On August 17th, we will be rolling out a change that may impact file/user permissions. In order to stay consistent, we will be assigning your GID according to FERRY, our centralized user data source, depending on which notebook flavor you pick.

The following group (GID) assignments will apply:

DUNE: dune (9010)
CMS: us_cms (5063)
FIFE/Astro: fnalgrid (9767)
ACCEL-AI: accelai (8754)
ACORN: accel (8776)

Please note that this restricts the use of notebooks to VOs you are a member of, but we don't expect any breaking changes to happen to your current home directories.
