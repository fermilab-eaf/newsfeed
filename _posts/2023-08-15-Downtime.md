# Reminder: August 16th interruption in service

Hi EAF users,

There will be interruptions in service on Wednesday morning as we update certificates and switch the outgoing network gateway. We're hoping this is transparent, but I can't guarantee that - so please prepare for disruption to your work during that time.  We will also move the work originally planned for Thursday (changing GIDs for some users) to occur during that timeframe as well.
